## Human Resource Application
Human resource management is necessary to ensure businesses run efficiently and effectively. Integration of HR tasks with technology allows the streamlining of these processes leading to better management, resource allocation, and employee empowerment.

The goal of this project is to improve HR processes and employee working environment by creating a Human Resource System on a mobile platform that finds solutions and improvements to employees' current concerns and problems. From the needfinding phase, the team has found several points to tackle but will be focusing on 3 areas of HR management tasks, specifically attendance taking, leave application, and payslip management.
